Repository Name: Wine-Quality-Prediction-ML

Description:
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting wine quality using the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project employs various machine learning algorithms and techniques to create predictive models that estimate the quality of wines based on their chemical properties. The code is written in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing including data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines.
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization of data distributions, feature importance, and model performance.
Modular code structure for easy experimentation and extensibility.
Comprehensive Jupyter notebooks explaining each step of the process.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up a Python virtual environment and install required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
